<h1 title="">THE FOSSIL FORESTS OF THE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK.</h1>
<p class="center">By <span class="sc">F. H. Knowlton</span>,
<br /><i>United States Geological Survey.</i></p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>
<p>Isolated pieces of fossil wood are of comparatively common and
widespread occurrence, especially in the more recent geological deposits
of the West. Not infrequently scattered logs, stumps, and
roots of petrified or lignitized trees are brought to light, but only
exceptionally are they so massed and aggregated as to be worthy of
the designation of fossil forests. Examples of such are the celebrated
fossil forests of relatively late geological age near Cairo, Egypt,
the huge prostrate trunks in the Napa Valley near Calistoga, Cal.,
and the geologically much older and far more extensive forests now
widely known as the Petrified Forest National Monument in Apache
County, Ariz. But in many respects the most remarkable fossil
forests known are those now to be described in the Yellowstone
National Park. In the forests first mentioned the trunks and logs
were all prostrated before fossilization, and it is perhaps not quite
correct to designate such aggregations as veritable fossil forests,
though they usually are so called. In the fossil forests of Arizona,
for example, which are scattered over many square miles of what is
now almost desert, all the trunks show evidence of having been
transported from a distance before they were turned to stone. Most
of them are not even in the position in which they were originally
entombed, but have been eroded from slightly higher horizons and
have rolled in the greatest profusion to lower levels. As one views
these Arizona forests from a little distance, with their hundreds,
even thousands, of segments of logs, it is difficult to realize that they
are really turned to stone and are now exhumed from the earth.
The appearance they present (see <a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) is not unlike a &ldquo;log drive&rdquo;
that has been stranded by the receding waters and left until the bark
had disappeared and many logs had fallen into partial decay.
Trunks of many sizes and lengths are now mingled and scattered
about in the wildest profusion, and the surface of the ground is carpeted
with fragments of wood that have been splintered and broken
from them. In the Yellowstone National Park, however, most of
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
the trees were entombed in the upright position in which they grew,
by the outpouring of various volcanic materials, and as the softer
rock surrounding them is gradually worn away they are left standing
erect on the steep hillsides, just as they stood when they were living:
in fact, it is difficult at a little distance to distinguish some of these
fossil trunks from the lichen-covered stumps of kindred living
species. Such an aggregation of fossil trunks is therefore well
entitled to be called a true fossil forest. It should not be supposed,
however, that these trees still retain their limbs and smaller branches,
for the mass of volcanic material falling on them stripped them down
to bare, upright trunks.</p>

<p>The fossil forests of the Yellowstone National Park cover an extensive
area in the northern portion of the park, being especially
abundant along the west side of Lamar River for about 20 miles
above its junction with the Yellowstone. Here the land rises rather
abruptly to a height of approximately 2,000 feet above the valley
floor. It is known locally as Specimen Ridge, and forms an approach
to Amethyst Mountain. There is also a small fossil forest
containing a number of standing trunks near Tower Falls, and
near the eastern border of the park along Lamar River in the vicinity
of Cache, Calfee, and Miller Creeks, there are many more or
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
less isolated trunks and stumps of fossil trees, but so far as known
none of these are equal in interest to the fossil forest on the slopes
of Specimen Ridge.</p>

</div>
<p>The fossil forests are reached over a road from the Mammoth
Hot Springs, or from Camp Roosevelt near Tower Falls, and they are
in their way quite as wonderful and worthy of attention as many
of the other features for which the Yellowstone National Park is so
justly celebrated.</p>
<p>Recently another extensive fossil forest has been found on the
divide between the Gallatin and Yellowstone Rivers in the Gallatin
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Range of mountains, in Park and Gallatin Counties, Mont. This
forest, which lies just outside the boundary of the Yellowstone
National Park, is said to cover 35,000 acres and to contain some
wonderfully well preserved upright trunks, many of them very
large, equaling or perhaps even surpassing in size some of those
within the limits of the park. Two of the best preserved of these
trunks are shown in figures <a href="#fig2">2</a> and <a href="#fig3">3</a>, which are here reproduced by
the kindness of Mr. E. C. Alderson, of Bozeman, Mont.</p>
<p>In the beds of the streams and gulches coming down into the
Lamar River from Specimen Ridge and the fossil forests one may
observe numerous pieces of fossil wood, which may be traced for a
long distance down the Lamar and Yellowstone Rivers. The farther
these pieces of wood have been transported downstream, the more
they have been worn and rounded, until ultimately they become
smooth, rounded &ldquo;pebbles&rdquo; of the stream bed. The pieces of wood
become more numerous and fresher in appearance upstream toward
the bluffs, until at the foot of the cliffs in some places there are hundreds,
perhaps thousands of tons that have but recently fallen from
the walls above. One traversing the valley of the Lamar River may
see at many places numerous upright fossil trunks in the faces of
nearly vertical walls. These trunks are not all at a particular level
but occur at irregular heights: in fact a section cut down through
these 2,000 feet of beds would disclose a succession of fossil forests
(see <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>). That is to say, after the first forest grew and was
entombed, there was a time without volcanic outburst&mdash;a period long
enough to permit a second forest to grow above the first. This in
turn was covered by volcanic material and preserved, to be followed
again by a period of quiet, and these more or less regular alternations
of volcanism and forest growth continued throughout the time the
beds were in process of formation.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.</span></h2>
<p>While these fossil forests were growing and being entombed, much
of the area now within the limits of the park, as well as large adjacent
areas, was the scene of tremendous geologic activities. After the
Cretaceous period (see diagram <a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>), there was a time of great
volcanic activity, which appears to have lasted until perhaps the beginning
of the glacial epoch. There were many active volcanoes just
west, north, and west of the park, and some in the park itself. From
these volcanoes vast quantities of material were poured out, building
up in places whole mountain ranges. Thus the major portion of the
great Absaroka Range, just east of the park, as it appears to-day,
was built up of volcanic material.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Fig. 4.&mdash;Ideal section through 2,000 feet of beds of Specimen Ridge, showing
succession of buried forest. After Holmes.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Mr. Arnold Hague gives the following graphic account of this and
adjacent areas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From one end to the other the Absarokas present a high, imposing plateau,
with elevations ranging from 10,000 to over 12,000 feet above sea level. The
entire mass is made up almost exclusively of Tertiary igneous rocks. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Degradation of the mass has taken place on a grand scale. Vast quantities of
volcanic ejectmenta have been removed from the summit, but no reliable data
exist by which the amount can be estimated even approximately. All the higher
portions have been sculptured by glacial ice. Enormous amphitheaters have
been carved out of the loose agglomerates, and peaks, pinnacles, and relics of
great table-lands testify in some measure to the forces of erosion. The plateau
is scored by a complete network of deep valleys and gorges, which dissect it in
every direction, and lay bare the structure of the vast volcanic
pile.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the park there is evidence of similar volcanic activity, and
it is clear that the basin between the encircling ranges was filled to
its present elevation by volcanic flows, which formed the present
park plateau. The area within which the fossil forests are now
found was apparently in the beginning an irregular but relatively
flat basin, on the floor of which after a time there grew the first
forest. Then there came from some of the volcanoes, probably those
to the north, an outpouring of ashes, mud flows, and other material
which entirely buried the forest, but so gradually that the trees were
simply submerged by the incoming material, few of them being prostrated.
On the raised floor of the basin, after a time, the next forest
came into existence, only to be in turn engulfed as the first had been,
and so on through the period represented by the 2,000 feet or more of
similar beds. The series of entombed forests affords a means of
making at least a rough estimate of the time required for the upbuilding
of what is now Specimen Ridge and its extensions. (See
<a href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>.)</p>
<p>During the time this 2,000 feet of material was being accumulated,
and since then to the present day, there has been relatively little
warping of the earth&rsquo;s crust at this point; that is, the beds were then,
and still are, practically horizontal, so that the fossil forests, as they
are being gradually uncovered, still stand upright.</p>
<p>When the volcanic activities had finally ceased, the ever-working
disintegrating forces of nature began to tear and wear down this
accumulated material, eroding the beds on a grand scale. Deep canyons
and gulches have been trenched, and vast quantities of the softer
materials have been carried away by the streams and again deposited
on lower levels or transported to great and unknown distances.</p>
<p>As the material in which the fossil forests are now entombed consist
of ashes, mud flows, breccia, and the like, not all the beds are of the
same texture end hardness, so that erosion has acted unevenly on
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
them and has produced many peculiar rock forms. The grotesque
so-called &ldquo;hoodoos&rdquo; have been carved out in this manner. The
fossil trunks, being usually harder than the surrounding matrix in
which they are embedded, have more firmly resisted erosion and now
project to different heights above the general level. In exposed
beds that are nearly or quite horizontal, disintegration has acted at
nearly equal pace on the trunks and on the matrix, so that the trunks
are nearly or quite on a level with the surrounding surface. On
steep hillsides, however, from which all loose material is easily and
quickly removed, some of the fossil trunks stand up to a height of
20 or 30 feet. If the beds had been tilted at a considerable angle,
these trunks could project from the surface for only a short distance
before their weight would break them off, showing again the remarkably
stable conditions that have continued since the trunks were
covered up.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">AMETHYST MOUNTAIN.</span></h2>
<p>The fossil forest that was first brought to scientific attention is
on the northern slope of Amethyst Mountain, opposite the mouth of
Soda Butte Creek, 12 miles southeast of Camp Roosevelt. The
following account, by Dr. William H. Holmes, the discoverer of
these fossil forests, shows the impression first made by them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we ride up the trail that meanders the smooth river bottom [Lamar
River] we have but to turn our attention to the cliffs on the right hand to
discover a multitude of the bleached trunks of the ancient forests. In the
steeper middle portion of the mountain face, rows of upright trunks stand
out on the ledges like the columns of a ruined temple. On the more gentle
slopes farther down, but where it is still too steep to support vegetation, save
a few pines, the petrified trunks fairly cover the surface, and were at first
supposed by us to be shattered remains of a recent forest.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These trunks may easily be seen from the road along the Lamar
River, about a mile away. They stand upright&mdash;as Holmes has said,
like the pillars of some ruined temple&mdash;and a closer view shows that
there is a succession of these forests, one above another. In the
foothills and several hundred feet above the valley there is a perpendicular
wall of volcanic breccia, which in some places attains a
height of nearly 100 feet. The fossil trunks may be seen in this
wall in many places, all of them standing upright, in the position
in which they grew. Some of these trunks, which are 2 to 4 feet
in diameter and 20 to 40 feet high, are so far weathered out of the
rock as to appear just ready to fall: others are only slightly exposed:
niches mark the places from which others have already fallen:
and the foot of the cliff is piled high with fragments of various sizes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Above this cliff fossil trunks appear in great numbers and in regular
succession. As they are all perfectly silicified, they are more resistant
than the surrounding matrix and consequently stand above
it. Most of them are only a few inches above the surface, but occasionally
one rises as high as 5 or 6 feet. The largest trunk observed
in the park is found in this locality. It is a little over 10 feet in
diameter, a measurement that includes a part of the bark. It is
very much broken down, especially in the interior, probably having
been so disintegrated before it was fossilized. It projects about 6
feet above the surface.</p>
<p>At many places about Amethyst Mountain there are numerous
fragments of fossil wood and many hollow trunks. The material
in which they had been embedded has been eroded away, and they lie
around in somewhat the same attitudes that are shown by all the
trunks in the Arizona fossil forests, but there is little doubt that
they were originally erect and have simply fallen by their own
weight because of the removal of the material around them.</p>
<p>Many of the trunks here, as well as elsewhere in the park, had
decayed in the center before they were fossilized, and some of the
hollow interiors are filled with clusters and rosettes of beautiful
crystals of amethyst, which doubtless suggested the name given to
the adjacent mountain. Much of this finely preserved wood, as well
as the trunks containing the crystals of amethyst, was broken up
and carried away by collectors of minerals and curiosities before the
Government control in the park was made sufficiently rigid to insure
proper protection.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">SPECIMEN RIDGE.</span></h2>
<p>In many respects the most remarkable of the fossil forests is on
the northwest end of Specimen Ridge, about a mile southeast of
Junction Butte and about opposite the mouth of Slough Creek. So
far as known, this forest was first brought to scientific attention by
Mr. E. C. Alderson, of Bozeman, Mont., and the writer, who discovered
it in August, 1887. It is found on the higher part of the
ridge, and covers several acres. The trees are exposed at various
heights on the very steep hillsides, and one remarkable feature of the
forest is that most of them project well above the surface.</p>
<p>One of the largest and best preserved trees stands at the very
summit of the slope (see title page). This trunk, which is that of a
giant redwood, is 26&frac12; feet in circumference without the bark and
about 12 feet in height. The portion of this huge trunk preserved
is the base, and it exhibits to a considerable degree the swelling or
buttressing so well known in the living redwood. The roots, which
are as large as the trunks of ordinary trees, are now embedded in
solid rock.</p>

</div>
<p>On the steep hillside a short distance below the big tree just mentioned
are the two trunks shown in <a href="#fig5" id="rfig5">figure 5</a>. They are about 2 feet
in diameter and 25 feet high, and stand some 20 feet apart, and we
may imagine them to have formed the doorposts of the &ldquo;ancient
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
temple&rdquo; of which Holmes speaks. Both these trunks are without
the bark. On the left of the figure is one of the huge irregular
masses of rock that has been carved out by erosion.</p>

</div>
<p>In <a href="#fig6" id="rfig6">figure 6</a> is shown another trunk about 3 feet in diameter and
nearly 30 feet high. In several places along the trunk the thick bark
may be noted. This tree is a pine, as are the two last described, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
slightly below and behind it are two living pine trees, which are about
the size it must have been when living. Another trunk, some 12 feet
in height, is shown in <a href="#fig7" id="rfig7">figure 7</a>, and in <a href="#fig8" id="rfig8">figure 8</a> there may be noted a
standing trunk and above it another that has recently fallen.</p>

</div>
<p>The height attained by the trees of this fossil forest can not be
ascertained with certainty, since the tallest trunk now standing is
only about 30 feet high, but every one observed is obviously broken
off, and does not show even the presence of limbs. Perhaps the nearest
approach to a measure of the height is afforded by a trunk (shown
in <a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>) that happened to have been prostrated before fossilization.
This trunk, which is 4 feet in diameter, is exposed for a length
of about 40 feet, and as it shows no apparent diminution in size
within this distance it is safe to assume that the tree could hardly
have been less than 100 feet high and very probably may have been
higher. This trunk is wonderfully preserved. As may be seen from
the illustration, it has broken up by splitting along the grain of the
wood into great numbers of little pieces, which closely resemble
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
pieces of &ldquo;kindling wood&rdquo; split from a clear-grained block. In fact,
at a distance of a few yards it would be impossible to distinguish
this fossil &ldquo;kindling wood&rdquo; from that split from a living tree.</p>

</div>
<p>The large redwood trunk already mentioned (<a href="#cover">title-page</a>) as being
nearly 10 feet in diameter may be compared with its living relative
of the Pacific coast in order to calculate its probable height. The
living redwood is usually 10 to 15 feet in diameter and ranges in
height from 200 to 310 feet, and as the two are so very closely related
there is no reason to suppose that the fossil trunk was of less height,
but by a moderate estimate it may be accredited with a minimum
height of 200 feet.</p>

<p>The most accessible fossil forest, marked "Petrified Trees" on
the map, is west of the Tower Falls Ranger Station and Camp
Roosevelt on the road from the Grand Canyon to Mammoth Hot
Springs, by way of Mount Washburn. It is on the middle slope of
a hill that rises about 1,000 feet above the little valley and may be
reached by a branch road from the main loop road. As the traveler
approaches the forest he will observe a number of trunks standing
upright among the stumps and trunks of living trees, and so much
resembling them that a near view is necessary to convince him that
they are really fossil trunks. Only two rise to a considerable height
above the surface. The larger one is about 15 feet high and 13 feet in
circumference (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>): the other is a little smaller. As the roots are
not exposed, it is impossible to determine the position of the part in
view or the original diameter of the trees, as the bark is nowhere
preserved.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Fig. 11.&mdash;Fossil trunk near Tower Falls.</span>

</div>
<p>Above these standing trunks lie many others, which the disintegrating
forces of nature break up into small fragments and keep
at about the same level as that of their surrounding matrix. Some of
these trunks rise only a few inches from the surface: others are
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
nearly covered by shifting d&eacute;bris. Their diameter ranges from 1 to
14 feet, and they are so perfectly preserved that the rings of growth
can easily be counted. The internal structure is also in most trunks
nearly as perfect as when the trees were living.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CACHE CREEK.</span></h2>
<p>The forest that is next in size to the one a mile southeast of Junction
Butte is on Cache Creek, about 7 miles above its mouth. It is
on the south bank of the creek and covers several acres. The trunks
are scattered from bottom to top of the slopes through a height of
probably 800 feet. Most of the trunks are upright, but only a few
project more than 2 or 3 feet above the surface. The largest one
observed was 6 feet in height and 4 feet in diameter. Most of these
trunks appear to the naked eye to be conifers, but a number are
obviously dicotyledons&mdash;that is, they were deciduous-leaved trees.
The conifers, however, were the predominant element in this as in
the other fossil forests.</p>
<p>The slopes of the Thunderer, the mountain so prominently in view
from Soda Butte on the south, also bear numerous fossil trunks.
Most of them are upright, but only a very few project more than 2
feet above the surface. No remarkably large trunks were observed
at this locality, the average diameter being perhaps less than 2 feet.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">OTHER LOCALITIES.</span></h2>
<p>Mount Norris, which is hardly to be separated from the Thunderer,
also bears a small fossil forest. The trees are of about the
same size and character as those in the larger mountain. Fossil
forests of greater or less extent, composed mainly of upright trunks,
are exposed also on Baronett Peak, Bison Peak, Abiathar Peak,
Crescent Hill, and Miller Creek. In fact, there is hardly a square
mile of the area of the northeastern portion of the park that is
without its fossil forest, scattered trunks, or erratic fragments.</p>
<p>The vast area east of the Yellowstone Lake and the region still
farther east, beyond the limits of the park, have not been thoroughly
explored, but enough is known to make it certain that these areas
contain more or less fossil wood. The stream beds in these areas in
many places contain fragments of fossil wood, which indicates that
trunks of trees must be near at hand.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">THE PROCESS OF FOSSILIZATION.</span></h2>
<p>The manner in which these forests were fossilized may next be
considered. Though the whole history of the process is not fully
understood, it was undoubtedly dependent on or at least greatly
facilitated by the presence of volcanic and hydrothermal activity,
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
which was doubtless then, as it is to some extent now, a marked feature
of the park region. At least a hint of the probable process is
afforded by the action now going on in the hot spring areas. Many
of those areas are closely surrounded by forests, and unless the action
of the springs is very violent the trees may be growing only a short
distance away. Occasionally a hot spring may break out near the
edge of a forest, the first effect being, of course, to kill the trees.
In a few years, by the action of the ordinary processes of decay, a
tree so killed may have lost its bark and most of its smaller branches.
The hot water which constantly or intermittently surrounds the
tree contains a considerable amount of silica in solution, and as this
hot silica-charged water is drawn up into the wood by capillarity the
silica may be deposited in the cells of the wood after the water cools
or evaporates. The first result will be a more or less complete cast
of the interior of the cells and vessels of the wood. This much of
the process has actually been observed, but as decay is more rapid
than silicification, the wood crumbles to dust before petrifaction is
complete. If the trunk could be surrounded by ashes or mud and
thus protected from atmospheric action, it might in time be completely
turned to stone.</p>
<p>The fossil forests are surrounded by a matrix that is known as an
acidic lava&mdash;that is, a siliceous lava&mdash;which contains abundant silica
in solution. The first part of the process of silicification may well
have been that above described as taking place in the hot spring areas
at the present day&mdash;that is, the silica would be deposited in all the
cells and vessels of the wood, making an accurate cast of all open
spaces. Then, while the slow process of decay went on, as each particle
of organic matter was removed its place was taken by the silica,
until, finally, all the wood substance had disappeared and its place
atom by atom had been taken by silica.</p>
<p>By this or a similar process the wood has been preserved or fossilized
with remarkable fidelity: in fact, thin sections or slices of the
fossil wood may be studied under the higher powers of the microscope
with almost or quite as much completeness and satisfaction as
if they were sections cut from a piece of living wood. Each cell and
vessel, with its characteristic pits and markings, is preserved exactly
as it grew. Some of the wood, however, was evidently more or less
decayed before it was fossilized, or else decay worked faster than
replacement, so that in some fragments the structure is not so clearly
preserved. Many of the trunks were subjected to pressure before
replacement was complete, and this has crushed or distorted the cells.
On the whole, however, the wood is exceptionally well preserved, as
may be seen in figures <a href="#fig12">12</a>, <a href="#fig13">13</a>, <a href="#fig14">14</a>, and <a href="#fig15">15</a>. These are all magnified
100 diameters and were photographed directly from the thin sections&mdash;that
is, they are photomicrographs&mdash;and have not been retouched
in any manner. <a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a> shows a transverse section of the
wood of the large redwood trunk that has been so often mentioned
(see <a href="#cover">title page</a>). The section is cut through one of the growth rings,
which consists of 12 or 15 rows of very thick-walled cells. The large,
regular thin-walled cells, which begin abruptly above the growth
ring, belong to the spring wood&mdash;that is, the wood first formed after
growth starts in spring, when the supply of nourishment is abundant.
If there is sufficient moisture and all conditions are favorable this
vigorous growth of wood cells may continue without interruption
until the approach of cold or dry weather, but not infrequently there
may be a brief shortage of moisture, and this is reflected in the formation
of a few rows of thicker-walled cells. Such a condition may
be observed in the present specimen, in which a slight, partial ring
may be seen at some distance above the main ring.</p>

<p>The very perfect preservation of the wood of one of the pines
(<i>Pityoxylon amethystinum</i>) is shown in <a href="#fig13" id="rfig13">figure 13</a>, a view of a section
cut through a part of a growth ring and into the spring and
summer wood, the rings in this species being so broad that it is
impossible to show a complete one. The opening near the bottom of
the figure shows one of the large resin ducts, which, in the living
wood, is filled with the &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; that so readily exudes when a branch
is cut or broken. A longitudinal section of the other species of pine
(<i>Pityoxylon aldersoni</i>) is shown in <a href="#fig14" id="rfig14">figure 14</a>. The many little rows
of superimposed cells in the midst of the long wood cells are the cut-off
ends of what are known as medullary rays&mdash;that is, the little
plates of cells that connect pith and bark. One of the resin cells cut
in the long direction is shown near the center of the figure; the contents
are much darker than that of the wood cells.</p>
<p>The very great difference between the sections of coniferous wood
just described and the wood of a deciduous tree is brought out in
<a href="#fig15" id="rfig15">figure 15</a>, which is a longitudinal section of a laurel (<i>Laurinoxylon
pulchrum</i>). In this the wood cells are relatively much smaller and
shorter, and the medullary rays are in several irregular rows. The
large dotted duct near the middle of the figure is a feature not
present in coniferous trees.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">SPECIES REPRESENTED.</span></h2>
<p>An enumeration of the kinds of trees that are represented by the
woods in the fossil forests of the Yellowstone National Park will
naturally be demanded. A superficial or macroscopic examination of
these trunks would not permit a close decision as to the kind of wood:
in fact, it would hardly be possible to do more than separate them by
this means into coniferous and dicotyledonous trees. But by studying
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
thin sections under the microscope it is possible to distinguish
the different kinds with reasonable accuracy. As the result of such
study the following species have been detected:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Magnificent redwood (Sequoia magnifica).</p>
<p class="t0">Alderson&rsquo;s pine (Pityoxylon aldersoni).</p>
<p class="t0">Amethyst pine (Pityoxylon amethystinum).</p>
<p class="t0">Laurel (Laurinoxylon pulchrum).</p>
<p class="t0">Aromatic bay (Perseoxylon aromaticum),</p>
<p class="t0">Hayden&rsquo;s sycamore (Plantaninium haydeni).</p>
<p class="t0">Knowlton&rsquo;s sycamore (Plantaninium knowltoni).</p>
<p class="t0">Felix&rsquo;s buckthorn (Rhamnacinium radiatum).</p>
<p class="t0">Lamar oak (Quercinium lamarense).</p>
<p class="t0">Knowlton&rsquo;s oak (Quercinium knowltoni).</p>
</div>
<p>Although only three kinds of coniferous trees have thus far been
found in the fossil forests of the park, fully 95 per cent of all the
trunks belong to these three species. The preponderance of conifers
is probably due to the facts that they were presumably more
abundant in the beginning, and that, in general, coniferous wood
decays less rapidly than that of most of deciduous-leaved trees. But
the conditions were so favorable for preserving any wood that it is
perhaps strange that not more trunks of deciduous-leaved trees have
been found there. As it is, however, a greater number are known
from the park than from any other region. Thus, the Arizona fossil
forests embraced only two species of deciduous-leaved trees: the
Calistoga (California) wood only one species, and the forest at Cairo,
Egypt, only four species.</p>
<p>The 10 species of trees represented in the fossil forests of the park
are by no means the only fossil plants that have been found. The fine-grained
ashes and volcanic mud in which the forests were entombed
contain also great numbers of impressions of plants, many of them
very perfectly preserved. Most of these are impressions of foliage,
such as fronds and leaves, but they include also roots, stems, branches,
fruiting organs, and even what is believed to be the petals of a large
magnolia flower. About 150 different kinds of fossil plants have
been found in the park, 80 in the same beds with the forests, and
most of the others in slightly higher and younger beds. The list
embraces 10 ferns, among them a fine chain fern (Woodwardia),
several aspleniums, and a beautiful little climbing fern (Lygodium).
The horse-tails (Equisetum) are represented by 4 species. The
conifers include no less than 6 species of pines (Pinus), a yew (Taxodium),
and 2 sequoias. These have been identified either from the
foliage or the cones, and it is more than likely that some of the
specimens may represent organs that belonged to trees represented
by the fossil trunks, but as they have never been found connected
they have been described separately. The monocotyledons, or plants
with parallel-veined leaves, are represented by only a few forms,
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
such as a single large grass (Phragmites), a few sedges (Cyperacites),
a smilax, and a curious broad-leaved banana-like plant (Musophyllum).
The dicotyledons, or deciduous-leaved plants, make up
the bulk of the flora and include walnuts (Juglans), hickory nuts
(Hicoria), bay berries (Myrica), poplars (Populus), willows (Salix),
birches (Betula), hazel nuts (Corylus), beech nuts (Fagus),
chestnuts (Castanea), oaks (Quercus), elms (Ulmus), figs (Ficus),
breadfruits (Artocarpus), magnolias (Magnolia), laurels (Laurus),
bays (Persea), cinnamons (Cinnamomum), sycamores (Plantanus),
acacias (Acacia), sumachs (Rhus), bittersweet (Celastrus), maples
(Acer), soap berries (Sapindus), buckthorns (Rhammus), grapes
(Cissus), basswood (Tilia), aralias (Aralia), dogwoods (Cornus),
persimmons (Diospyros), ash (Fraxinus), and a number of others
without vernacular names.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">COMPARISON WITH LIVING FORESTS.</span></h2>
<p>A brief comparison of the fossil forests with the forests now living
in the Yellowstone National Park may be of some interest. The
present forests are prevailingly coniferous, the most abundant and
widely distributed tree being the lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus murrayana</i>),
which forms dense forests over much of the plateau region. It is
distinguished by having the leaves in clusters of two. It is a tree
with a slender trunk, usually 70 or 80 feet high, though in exceptionally
favorable localities it may reach a height of 150 feet. Its diameter
rarely exceeds 2 or 3 feet. The areas ravaged by forest fires are
usually reforested by this pine alone, and the young trees come up so
close together as to form thickets that can scarcely be penetrated.</p>
<p>There are two other pines in the park, both white pines, allied to
the common white pine of the Eastern States, and like it both have the
leaves in clusters of 5. One, known as the Rocky Mountain white
pine (<i>Pinus flexilis</i>) is a small tree, only 40 or 50 feet in height, and
usually grows singly or in small groves. The other, called the Western
white pine (<i>Pinus albicaulis</i>), is still smaller, being usually 20
to 30 feet high, and has a short trunk some 2 to 4 feet in diameter.
It grows on high slopes and exposed ridges.</p>
<p>Perhaps next in abundance to the lodgepole pine is the white or
Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea engelmanni</i>), a tall, handsome tree with
disagreeable smelling foliage. Another rather abundant tree is the
Douglas spruce, or red fir (<i>Pseudotsuga mucronata</i>), which, where
best developed on the Pacific coast, attains a height of 200 feet,
though in the drier interior it is rarely over 80 or 100 feet high.
There are also two species of fir, the white fir (<i>Abies grandis</i>) and
the Balsam fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>), and a single juniper (<i>Juniperus
communis siberica</i>), which is often scarcely more than a shrub.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The deciduous-leaved trees are almost a negligible element in the
present park flora, being confined to an occasional cottonwood
(<i>Populus angustifolia</i>) at the lower elevations, along the Yellowstone
River, and small groves of the quaking aspen (<i>Populus
tremuloides</i>). Along the streams and in wet places there are many
species of willow (Salix) and several alders (Alnus), and in mountain
bogs and valleys there is a small birch (<i>Betula glandulosa</i>).
There are, of course, many small shrubs, such as gooseberries,
currants, and roses.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">AGE OF THE FOSSIL FORESTS.</span></h2>
<p>The question is often asked, How old are the fossil forests? It is,
of course, impossible to fix their age exactly in years, though it is
easy enough to place them in the geologic time scale. The stratified
rocks that make up the crust of the earth, from the oldest we know
to the most recent, have been divided by geologists into a number
of major divisions or systems, each&mdash;except perhaps the oldest&mdash;containing
the remains of certain kinds of plants and animals.
The accompanying diagram (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>), shows these major time divisions,
arranged in their proper sequence from the lowest to the
highest. The star (*) in this geologic time scale indicates the age
of the rocks in which the fossil forests were entombed. It shows
that they were buried during the Tertiary period. This period is
divided into four epochs, the oldest called Eocene, having been succeeded
in turn by the Oligocene, the Miocene, and the Pliocene, which
just precedes the Pleistocene or glacial epoch. The forests of the
Yellowstone National Park are found in the Miocene series of the
Tertiary. As compared with the eons of geologic time that preceded
it the Miocene is relatively very recent, though, if the various estimates
of the age of the earth that have been made by geologists are
anywhere near correct it may well have been a million years ago.
It must be remembered, however, that this estimate involves more or
less speculation based on a number of factors which may or may not
have been correctly interpreted.</p>
<p>A study of the fossil trees themselves gives at least a rough approximation
as to the length of time it may have taken to accumulate
the beds in which they are now buried. As already mentioned,
there is a succession of forests, one above another, through a thickness
of 2,000 feet of strata. The unit of the measure of the time is
the time taken by each forest to grow. Pine trees of the types represented
in the fossil trunks require 200 or 300 years to reach maturity,
and redwoods may require from 500 to 1,000 years. Twelve or more
of these forest levels have been found. By multiplying this number
by the minimum age of the trees (200 years) we shall have 2,400
years, and by multiplying it by the maximum age of the redwood
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
(1,000 years) we shall have 12,000 years as the possible time during
which these forests flourished. It is possible that the truth lies somewhere
between these extremes.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CLIMATE DURING THE LIFE OF THE FOSSIL TREES.</span></h2>
<p>A final word may be added regarding the probable climate of the
region during the lifetime of these fossil forests. It is obvious that
the present flora of the Yellowstone National Park has comparatively
little relation to the Tertiary flora and can not be considered
the descendant of it. It is also clear that the climatic conditions
must have greatly changed since Tertiary time. The Tertiary flora
appears to have come from the south, but the present flora is evidently
of more northern origin. The climate during Tertiary time, as
indicated by the vegetation, was temperate or warm-temperate, not
unlike that of Virginia or the Carolinas at the present time, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
presence of numerous species of figs, a supposed bread-fruit tree,
cinnamons, bays, and other southern plants indicates that it may
have been almost subtropical. However, the conditions that were
favorable to this seemingly subtropical growth may have been different
from the conditions now necessary for the growth of similar
vegetation. It may be that these supposed subtropical plants were at
that time so constituted as to grow in a temperate land, and that they
may have become tropical in recent times. Following this general
line of thought it may be said that although the Tertiary vegetation
of the Yellowstone National Park would now be regarded as indicating
a temperate or even warmer climate, the actual climate may
not have been subtropical. It is certain, however, that the conditions
were very different from those now prevailing in the park.</p>
